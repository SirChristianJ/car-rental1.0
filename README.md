# car-rental1.0
Car rental service [not complete]

todo:
1)complete a user profile page so when a user logs in they're presented with their personalized page. (ejs will have to be implemented)
2)create accessible pages under one session once the user logs in/ visualize the user session (user session works on the backend side of things just need the frontend to coincide with the user session such as 3)display html pages only accessible to a logged in user, post a review, view previous rentals, book a rental, etc)
4)add 3D models for each car and allow for 360 view of the cars exterior and interior
more to come ..
